# TODO.md

- check out these extensions when they support Godot 4.x

  - geequlim.godot-tools
  - neikeq.godot-csharp-vscode

- do we need to do custom drawing?
  - https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/2d/custom_drawing_in_2d.html
  - it is recommended over having lots of nodes to represent a bunch of small/trivial objects
